Hearing Test

----This program is in no way a substitution for a doctor----

This Hearing Test is built in Java by students of the Vincentian Academy.
The Hearing Test is meant to test an individual's capability to hear sounds
of different frequencies and amplitudes.

It is scored out of 150 points.
These points are determined by the user's reaction time, as well as the user
pressing the correct corresponding ear.
